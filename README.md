Simple programme I made to help with my work that takes the required height, width and thickness of a pass door to be manufactured, then returns the sizes of framing needed,
including spacers to evenly space out the rails. If a sliding door mechanism is to be fitted to the bottom of the door, the programme takes this into account.
